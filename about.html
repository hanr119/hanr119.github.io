        <p>Hello, my name is Ray Han, and I am a sophomore at Parsons School of Design. I enjoy both digital and analog works and I am constantly curious to learn new artistic skills and disciplines. My major is Communications Design, but due to my wide range of interests, my skillset includes (but is not limited to) painting, technical drawing, graphic design, and sewing. This website is a portfolio collection of my website designs from my Spring 2021 semester.</p>
